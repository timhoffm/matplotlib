3rd party scales do not need to have an *axis* parameter anymore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since matplotlib 3.1 `PR 12831 <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/12831>`_
scales should be reusable and therefore independent of the Axis. Therefore the use of
of the *axis* parameter in the ``__init__`` had been discouraged. However, that
parameter was still necessary for API compatibility. This is no longer the case.

`.register_scale` now accepts scale classes with and without this parameter.
3rd party scales can and should remove that parameter.
